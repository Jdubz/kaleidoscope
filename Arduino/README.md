Arduino Libraries
=================

Install Instructions
--------------------
OSX: Copy (or better yet, link), the folders in to your Arduino project folder.
On my machine, this defaulted to ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries. Re-open the
Arduino IDE, go to Sketch -> Include Library -> [Library name]. This should 
pretty much just work.
